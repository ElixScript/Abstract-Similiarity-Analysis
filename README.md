# 📚 **Pattern Recognition Assignment: Abstract Similarity Analysis**

This repository contains the implementation of a **Pattern Recognition** task to compare the similarity levels between abstracts of research papers from **IJCCS (Indonesian Journal of Computing and Cybernetics Systems)**.

---

## 📋 **Assignment Description**
This assignment includes the following steps:
1. **Dataset**:
   - Using 10 abstracts from IJCCS in **Indonesian** or **English** (from the last 5 years).
2. **Feature Representation and similiarity measurement**:
   - Comparing abstracts using **TF-IDF method and Cosine Similiarity**.
3. **Programming Language**:
   - Python 

---

## 🚀 **Project Objectives**
- **Analyze the similarity between documents** using different feature representation methods and similarity measurements.
- Understand how text preprocessing steps affect the similarity analysis results.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies and Libraries**
- **Programming Language**:
  - Python (or other relevant programming languages).
- **Recommended Libraries**:
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK or Sastrawi (for preprocessing Indonesian texts)
  - Gensim
  - NumPy and Pandas
  - Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🔍 **Processing Steps**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Dataset consists of 10 abstracts from IJCCS (in `.txt` or `.csv` format).
2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning: Remove special characters, numbers, and symbols.
   - Tokenization: Split text into tokens.
   - Stopword Removal: Remove insignificant words.
   - Stemming: Convert words to their base forms.
3. **Feature Representation**:
   - TF-IDF: A statistical-based representation.
   - Word2Vec: An embedding-based representation.
4. **Similarity Measurement**:
   - Cosine Similarity: Measures the angle between two vectors.
   - Jaccard Similarity: Measures the overlap between two sets.
